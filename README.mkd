## Background

Genomic analyses require jumping back and forth between many bioinformatics tools.
The data types are young, thus so are the tools. This leads to frequent
updates of tools that are often challenging to install. Furthermore, it is
challenging to keep different versions of software for different projects, yet
changing versions can make analyses difficult to reproduce. To make matters worse,
genomicists often lack the skills necessary to setup complex bioinformatics software,
and systems administrators can be overwhelmed by large numbers of software
installation requests.

## Aim

We are developing `oswitch` to enable **seamless switching
from one operating system to another** - providing access to diverse
ranges of tools. This project grew from our own need to rapidly access 
diverse pieces of specific versions of software including those distributed as part of
[BioLinux](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/) on our MacBooks
and our university HPC system. This was previously too difficult, but is
important for [reproducible research](http://www.software.ac.uk) and agility.
@bmpvieira made it clear early on that the [docker](http://docker.io/) could
help make something happen. We first shared the resulting concept during a
[Balti & Bioinformatics](http://nickloman.github.io/balti/2014/05/01/balti-and-bioinformatics-27th-may-2014/)
presentation in the form of this (now out of date!) slide:

Docker images feel similar to using virtual machine images - but are much more
[flexible and light-weight](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-io-different-from-a-normal-virtual-machine).
They are thus easily [shared or published](https://hub.docker.com/). We are extremely lucky to
be able to build upon this amazing technology.

## Features

**`oswitch` is a wrapper facilitating access to docker images**. Importantly, when switching
operating systems inside a shell, most things remain unchanged:

* Current working directory is maintained
* User name, uid and gid are maintained
* Login shell (bash/zsh/fish) is maintained
* Home directory is maintained (thus all .dotfiles and config files
  are maintained).
* read/write permissions are maintained
* Paths are maintained whenever possible. Thus volumes (external drives,
NAS, USB) mounted on the host are available in the container at the same
path.

## Example Usage

There are two broad usage scenarios: interactive use & non-interactive
use.

##### Use a package interactively in a normal command-line

Minimalist example:

```shell
Yannick@n56-169 ~/myproject> uname -a
Darwin n56-169.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk 14.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 14.0.0: Fri Sep 19 00:26:44 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2782.1.97~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
Yannick@n56-169 ~/myproject> oswitch yeban/biolinux
### You are now running: biolinux_8, in container: biolinux_8-27182. ###
Yannick@biolinux_8-27182 ~/myproject> uname -a
Linux biolinux_8-27182 3.16.4-tinycore64 #1 SMP Thu Oct 23 16:14:24 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Biologically relevant example:

```shell
# Trying to run blast.
pixel:~/test/ $ ls 
mygene.fasta
pixel:~/test/ $ cat mygene.fa
>myfavoritegene isthisone

pixel:~/test/ $ blastp -query mygene.fa -remote -db nr -outfmt 7 > mygene_blastp_nr.tab
zsh: command not found: blastp
# Indeed... blastp is missing from my MacBook. 

# Switch to BioLinux and run blastp.
pixel:~/test/ $ oswitch yeban/biolinux
###### You are now running: biolinux in container biolinux-7187. ######
biolinux-7187:~/test/ $ blastp -query mygene.fa -remote -db nr -outfmt 7 >  mygene_blastp_nr.tab
# BioLinux includes blastp, thus the command ran smoothly.

# View the result.
biolinux-7187:~/test/ $ head mygene_blastp_nr.tab
# BLASTP 2.2.28+
# Query: myfavoritegene isthisone

# [... potentially run other analyses that require biolinux things...]

# Return to normal operating system
biolinux-7187:~/test/ $ exit
pixel:~/test/ $ ls 
mygene.fasta mygene_blastp_nr.txt
# our newly generated file is where we'd expect it to be.
```

##### Use a package non-interactively

Alternatively, single commands can be run directly in a container
(e.g. BioLinux) without entering it interactively. This can
be useful to test new tools, or to run a single piece of
not-locally-installed software as part of a single command. The
container terminates automatically once the command has been
executed, output is printed to the terminal and can be redirected, and
the exit status of the command run within container is returned.

```shell
# Run command directly in BioLinux and view results if success.
pixel:~/test/ $ oswitch yeban/biolinux blastp -remote -query mygene.fa -db nr > mygene_blastp_nr.txt
```

##### Listing available operating system containers

OSwitch can pull any image from docker hub. You can see the images you pulled
from docker hub using oswitch as:

```shell
pixel:~ $ oswitch -l
yeban/biolinux:8
ubuntu:14.04
ontouchstart/texlive-full
ipython/ipython
```
	
##### Availability

We have tested OSwitch on:

* Mac OS X Yosemite
* Ubuntu 14.04.1
* CentOS 7

##### Caveats

* Some features work only for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS based docker images.
* Host directories/volumes with paths conflicting with container paths are
  skipped.
* SELinux must be disabled on CentOS for mounting volumes to work.
* [Volume mounting on Mac OS hosts is imperfect](#q-directories-mounted-within-container-on-mac-host-are-empty).

## Installation

OSwitch first requires a [working docker install](#Install and setup docker). 

#### Install oswitch

Requirements: Ruby 2.0 or higher.

    $ gem install oswitch

#### Test oswitch

    $ oswitch ubuntu:14.04

## Install and setup docker

##### Mac OS X

Installing docker is much easier than before - https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/

##### Ubuntu

Installing docker - https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/

Add yourself to docker group so you can run docker client without sudo:

```shell
    $ sudo usermod -aG docker `whoami`
    
    # then logout and login again for the above command to take effect
```
	
##### CentOS

Installing docker - https://docs.docker.com/installation/centos/

Add yourself to docker group so you can run docker client without sudo:

```shell
    $ sudo usermod -aG docker `whoami`
    
    # then logout and login again for the above command to take effect
```
	
Disable SELinux as it gets in the way of mounting volumes within the container:

```shell
    $ sed -i .bak 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/selinux/config

    # then reboot your system
```
	
The above command backs up the original file to `/etc/selinux/config.bak`. If
you are concerned about disabling SELinux, do note that we are trying to work
out a better solution.

#### Test that docker is correctly installed

The following should give an encouraging message: 

    $ docker run hello-world

## FAQ

##### Q. Directories mounted within container on Mac host are empty.
The problem is, on Mac `boot2docker` is the _real_ host, not OS X. `oswitch`
can mount only what's available to it from `boot2docker`. For example,
`/Applications`.

Run `boot2docker ssh ls /Applications` and you will find it empty as well.

The workaround is to correctly mount the directories you want in `boot2docker`
first.

```
boot2docker down
VBoxManage sharedfolder remove boot2docker-vm --name Applications
VBoxManage sharedfolder add boot2docker-vm --name Applications --hostpath /Applications
boot2docker up
boot2docker ssh "sudo mkdir -p /Applications && sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=50 Applications /Applications"
```

##### Q. cwd is empty in the container
This means the said directory was not mounted by oswitch, or was incorrectly
mounted. On Linux host, directories that can conflict with paths within
container are not mounted. On Mac, `boot2docker` can get in the way.

Please [report](https://github.com/yeban/oswitch/issues/new) this on our [issue
tracker](https://github.com/yeban/oswitch/issues). To help us debug, please
include:

1. the directory in question
2. the operating system you are running

##### Q. oswitch does not work with my docker image
Please [report](https://github.com/yeban/oswitch/issues/new) this on our [issue
tracker](https://github.com/yeban/oswitch/issues) with oswitch's output. If the
image you are using is not available via docker hub or another public
repository, please include the Dockerfile as well.

##### Q. How does all this work?
We create a new image on the fly that inherits from the given image. While creating
the new image we execute a shell script that installs packages required for
oswitch to work and creates a user in the image (almost) identical to that on the host.

## Roadmap

1. ~~make it possible to use docker containers without inheriting our
current baseimage~~
2. ~~gem distribution for easier installation~~
3. brew recipe for Mac
4. test on QMUL's compute cluster
5. create an SELinux policy to run oswitch on CentOS without having to disable
SELinux entirely
6. rpm and deb packages
7. make available images for common bioinformatics software
8. deploy at [RAL/JASMIN](http://www.jasmin.ac.uk)
